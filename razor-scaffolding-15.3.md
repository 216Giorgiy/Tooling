Scaffolding for Razor is currently a work in progress. In 15.3 we have shipped the initial set of scaffolders with Visual Studio 2017.

We have enabled some additional scenarios for command line scaffolding. For more info about how to scaffold on the command line for
Razor projects please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/model.

Over time we will be adding additional support into Visual Studio 2017 for Razor scaffolding.
