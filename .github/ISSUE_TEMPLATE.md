To report new issues, use the [Report a Problem](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/) tool. The GitHub Issue Tracker for the aspnet/Tooling repo is now deprecated in favor of the Report a Problem tool.

If you encounter a problem with Visual Studio, we want to know about it so that we can diagnose and fix it. By using the Report a Problem tool, you can collect detailed information about the problem, and send it to Microsoft with just a few button clicks. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/talk-to-us) for more details.
