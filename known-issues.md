# Known issues for ASP.NET Core support in Visual Studio 2015

## .NET Core 1.0.0 RC2 â€“ VS 2015 Tooling Preview 1

Known issues in this release.

Note: There is a known issue with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 RC, as a result of which, .NET Core 1.0.0 RC2 - VS 2015 Tooling Preview 1 may fail to install after Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 RC is installed. [See here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=808095) for additional details and workaround.

### Missing SDK

If you open an RC2 project (or RTW) and the corresponding .NET Core SDK is missing you'll get a dialog box similar to the following.

![error box missing sdk](./images/missing-sdk-rtm.png)

To workaround this you can install the correct version of the .NET SDK. You can use the links below.

#### RC2 SDK download links

| Platform    | Link          |
|-------------|---------------|
| Windows x64 | https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798398 |
| Windows x86 | https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798399 |

#### RTM SDK download links

| Platform    | Link          |
|-------------|---------------|
| Windows x64 | https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/preview/Installers/Latest/dotnet-dev-win-x64.latest.exe |
| Windows x86 | https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/preview/Installers/Latest/dotnet-dev-win-x86.latest.exe |

For more info see https://github.com/dotnet/cli/#installers-and-binaries

### Add New Item

In some cases the Add New Item dialog will select the wrong item by default. For example with the PowerShell tools installed when you start Add New Item one of the PowerShell templates may be selected by default. This is also impacting the Add Class menu option.

### Debugging Unhandled Exception dialog does not appear

In some cases the Unhandled Exception dialog does not appear when it should.

### Scaffolding

#### Limited to Web Individual Auth
Scaffolding is currently limited to the Web template with Individual Authentication. We are hoping to support scaffolding for all projects in the next release.

#### Connection string and EF Migrations on publish

Currently the scaffolding feature directly embeds the connection string into code. This doesn't work well if you also use the EF Migrations publish feature. To get these two to work well together, move the connection string from code into the `appsettings.json` file.

### Publish

#### Azure Web Apps

The shared framework is not available in Azure Web Apps yet. We are working on getting it included.

#### Publishing RC1 projects with RC2 tooling publishes source files

When publishing an RC1 project with RC2 tooling, source files will be published even if you checked the "No Source" checkbox in RC1. To change to publishing binaries you'll need to modify the publish profile (.pubxml file under Properties\PublishProfiles) to include the following. For details on the workaround see http://stackoverflow.com/a/37425515.

#### Target runtime dropdown

In some cases the target runtime debug dropdown doesn't get populated correctly. 

#### Preview always shows appsettings.production.json as delete

The web publish dialog always shows `appsettings.production.json` as being deleted even when it will not.

#### Publish and Org Auth projects

In some cases after publishing a project using Org Auth, the published application may fail to run.

### General

#### Dependencies not copied to the output folder

In some cases all dependencies are not copied to the output folder.

### AI+ Work & School Account + SSO (no Read/Write)

You may get an error when using Work and School accounts and AI.

More info: https://github.com/aspnet/Templates/issues/569

#### BrowserLink and signed applications

Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.BrowserLink.Loader package cannot be loaded in a signed web application. app.UseBrowserLink() must be removed for the application to run.

#### Property Page update while open

Having property page open and modifying properties in project.json doesn't update property page

#### IIS Express is an option for Console applications

IIS express shows up as an option in the Launch drop down on Debug page for Console Application

#### Issues with project-to-project references

There are some issues when using an .xproj  referencing a .csproj.

All outputs may not be copied to the output folder. For example when using reference assemblies.

[Roslyn #10471](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/10471) - Portable Class library - > Platform target 'AnyCPU' is not supported by one or more of the project's targets.

[dotnet cli #2961](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/2961) - Runtime error after add reference from xproj web app (netcoreapp) to PCL csproj with project.json (netstandard)


## ASP.NET 5 RC1


Here are the known issues with ASP.NET 5 RC1


#### Tooling issues related to install of ASP.NET 5 RC1

1. If you install ASP.NET 5 RC1 on a machine without Visual Studio 2015, then install Visual Studio 2015 later, you will need to repair 'ASP.NET 5 RC1' in Add/Remove programs to get tooling support in Visual Studio 2015 for ASP.NET 5 RC1

2. If you install ASP.NET 5 RC1 on a machine that already has Visual Studio 2015, then install a VS 2015 language pack, you will need to repair 'ASP.NET 5 RC1' in Add/Remove programs to get tooling support in Visual Studio for web projects

3. After installing RC1 Update 1, Browser Link may be disabled in DNX projects that are created after the installation.  If the Browser Link Dashboard displays "No current connections" when running or debugging a DNX project a repair of the update will correct the issue:
    1.	Close Visual Studio
    2.	Open Control Panel > Uninstall a Program
    3.	Right click on "Microsoft ASP.NET 5 RC1 Update 1"
    4.	Click "change"
    5.	In the ASP.NET 5 RC1 Update 1 Installer, click "Repair"

4. Visual Studio keeps showing suggested extensions in the yellow info bar when opening an HTML file. It also shows an error message when there are Git merge conflicts or with Annotate and Excluded Folder documents.

## ASP.NET 5 Beta8

Here are the known issues with ASP.NET 5 Beta8

#### ComponentModelCache needs to be cleared

Visual Studio caches some of it's internal state in the `ComponentModelCache` folder. In some cases this cache may be invalidated, but not updated correctly. The result is that you may run into a number of errors which cannot be explained directly.

For example any of the following error messages could indicate an issue with an invalid `ComponentModelCache`.

```
System.ArgumentException: Item has already been added. Key in dictionary: 'RazorSupportedRuntimeVersion'
```

```
    This project is incompatible with the current edition of Visual Studio:

    Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 Version 14.0.23107.0 D14REL
    Microsoft .NET Framework
    Version 4.6.00079

```

**Workaround**

To work around this.

 1. Close all instances of Visual Studio
 2. Delete the folder at `%localappdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\ComponentModelCache`
 3. Restart Visual Studio

#### Issues with NuGet

If you experience any issues with NuGet packages not being resolved, or being resolved to unexpected versions. The best thing to try install the latest version of NuGet from https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d345edc-2e2d-4a9c-b73b-d53956dc458d/file/146283/8/NuGet.Tools.vsix.

Some examples off issues that may be resolved by updating NuGet are below.

 - NuGet feed for nuget.org is disabled
 - Package restore returns `beta8` packages instead of `beta5` packages

#### System beep on stop debugging

With ASP.NET 5 Beta8 we have changed how web applications are hosted with the Visual Studio debugger. In this release when you stop debugging you may notice there is a system beep that occurs at the end of debugging. This is a known issue that should be fixed with the first update for Visual Studio 2015 itself. The only workaround is to disable system sounds for this release. There is no functional impact.

## ASP.NET 5 Beta6

#### First F5 with IIS Express may not work

Sometimes, after you create an ASP.NET Web Application project for the first time, when you hit F5 for the first time, iisexpress.exe will exit with error code 666.

![iisexpress-error](./images/beta6-iisx-error.png)

**Workaround**

If you run into this error you should be able to hit F5 again to get the project to launch correctly.

#### Access Denied when installing DNX runtime using DNVM

In some cases, when creating an ASP.NET 5 project, DNVM fails to install the DNX runtime, and you will see the following error in the DNVM log:

```
Installing to C:\Users\balach\.dnx\runtimes\dnx-clr-win-x86.1.0.0-beta6
Move-Item : Access to the path 'C:\Users\balach\.dnx\runtimes\temp\dnx-clr-win-x86.1.0.0-beta6' is denied.

```

**Workaround**

Restart Visual Studio and try creating the project again. DNVM should succeed this time.

#### For a project targeting only CoreCLR (dnxcore50), you could run into a failure during Publish

If you update your ASP.NET 5 web project to target only CoreCLR (only dnxcore50 in project.json), you might run into the following failure when you try to Publish with the default Publish settings.

```
The "Dnu" task failed unexpectedly.
The project being published does not support the runtime 'dnx-clr-win-x86.1.0.0-beta6'
```

**Workaround**

In the Settings tab of the Publish dialog, explicitly select dnx-coreclr as the target rather than using the 'Default'. See the image below.

![visual-studio-publish-dialog-dnx-selector](./images/beta6-pub-dnx.png)

## ASP.NET Beta5 / Visual Studio 2015 RTM

## Visual Studio 2015 RC

#### applicationHost.config file appears as an untracked file in Solution

The applicationHost.config file will sometimes appear as an untracked file in Solution Explorer. This file should not be checked in as it has user specific paths which will not work in team environments.

#### Removing dnx451 from project.json frameworks may lead to erroneous build errors for ASP.NET 5 Web Sites projects

If you remove the dnx451 value from the frameworks section in project.json for ASP.NET 5 Web Site projects you may receive an error similar to "The type or namespace name 'AspNet' does not exist in the namespace 'Microsoft' (are you missing an assembly reference?)". To work around this you can remove the file at Compiler\Preprocess\RazorPreCompilation.cs.

#### Unable to add a reference to a standard C# project (.csproj) from an ASP.NET 5 project which is missing global.json

If you are working in a solution with ASP.NET 5 projects that does not have a global.json file you may not be able to add a reference to a standard C# project (.csproj) from an ASP.NET 5 project.

#### Installing dnvm x64 CoreClr without installing the corresponding x86 version may cause errors

If you install an x64 CoreClr version of dnvm and use that as the default then you may get error message like "Cannot find the DNX runtime '<version>' â€¦ ". To work around this install the corresponding x86 version as well.

#### Publishing using Web Express may incorrectly report a failed status

When publishing using Visual Studio 2015 Web Express you may receive an error like "The InstallDir property does not exist in the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0." Even though this error is reported in most cases the site is actually published.

#### IntelliSense for version in bower.json may not work on localized builds

If you are using a localized version of Visual Studio 2015 IntelliSense for version of bower packages may not work in bower.json.
